# readmeGenerator


## Description

- I want to generate a professional README.md dynamically by answering a prompt in the terminal.
- This project was built to save time in the future with the set up of a README.md.
- This further "DRY"s up the process of creating an application by automating the initial set up of a README.md template.
- I learned that with JavaScript and template literals, you can put in work ahead of time to make future file set up much faster.

## Installation

Install inquirer and ensure JS files are linked with 'require'.

## Usage

<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. -->

To run, open index.js in integrated terminal in VS code and run 'node index.js' to initialize prompt.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
